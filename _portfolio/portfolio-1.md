title: "EBook Datascience"
excerpt: "In late Spring of 2023 a friend and I got to wondering about some statistical trends in the indie-publishing space. Some investigation revealed that there was a surprising lack of any public investigation to that end, besides one small LLC that does a decent job at providing some barebones stats (surprising, since this is a billion-dollar industry). We realized this might be a decent niche for a small business to serve, and took a crack at it.

While the resulting product was seemingly competitive with existing ones, it involved far too much regular time investment to upkeep. Thus, this turned into more of a learning project."
