excerpt: 'Written with Professor Siu-Cheong Lau, we develop an algebro-geometric formulation for neural networks in machine learning using the moduli space of framed quiver representations. We find natural Hermitian metrics on the universal bundles over the moduli whose expressions are independent of dimension vector, and show that their Ricci curvatures give a Kähler metric on the moduli. Moreover, we use toric moment maps to construct activation functions and prove the universal approximation theorem for the softmax function (also known as Boltzmann distribution) using toric geometry of the complex projective space.'
