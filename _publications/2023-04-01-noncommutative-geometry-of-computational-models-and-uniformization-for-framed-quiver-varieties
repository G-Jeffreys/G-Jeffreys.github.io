excerpt: 'Written with Professor Siu-Cheong Lau, we formulate a mathematical setup for computational neural networks using noncommutative algebras and near-rings, in motivation of quantum automata. We study the moduli space of the corresponding framed quiver representations, and find moduli of Euclidean and non-compact types in light of uniformization.'
