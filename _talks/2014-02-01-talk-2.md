This talk is a presentation of the paper [Quantum Finite Automata and Framed Quiver Moduli](https://g-jeffreys.github.io/publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2).

Written with Professor Siu-Cheong Lau, we find an application in quantum finite automata for the ideas and results of [Noncommutative Geometry of Computational Models and Uniformization for Framed Quiver Varieties](https://g-jeffreys.github.io/publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1) and [KÃ¤hler Geometry of Framed Quiver Moduli and Machine Learning](https://g-jeffreys.github.io/publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3). We reformulate quantum finite automata with multiple-time measurements using the algebraic notion of a near-ring. This gives a unified understanding towards quantum computing and deep learning. When the near-ring comes from a quiver, we have a nice moduli space of computing machines with a metric that can be optimized by gradient descent.
