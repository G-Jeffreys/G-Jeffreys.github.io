This talk is a presentation of the paper 'Quantum Finite Automata and Framed Quiver Moduli.'

Written with Professor Siu-Cheong Lau, we find an application in quantum finite automata for the ideas and results of [JL21] and [JL22]. We reformulate quantum finite automata with multiple-time measurements using the algebraic notion of a near-ring. This gives a unified understanding towards quantum computing and deep learning. When the near-ring comes from a quiver, we have a nice moduli space of computing machines with a metric that can be optimized by gradient descent.
