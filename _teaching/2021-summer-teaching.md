These are the courses I taught at Boston University in the summer of 2021.

Discrete Mathematics
======
This course covered propositional logic, set theory, elementary probability theory, number theory, combinatorics with applications.

Applications of Mathematics for Personal Finance
======
This course covered quantitative techniques involving
systems of equations, exponential functions, logarithms, probability, descriptive and
inferential statistics, and numerical simulation. The applications will included life cycle decisions
about spending and saving; borrowing and repayment; inflation and purchasing power,
taxation and government benefits; risk management, insurance and annuities; and
investments and asset allocation. Substantial focus was placed on using spreadsheet
software to practically implement, model, and study the above content.
